# DataPrepKit-project
In the DataPrepKit capstone project, I will embark on developing a Python package named "DataPrepKit." This package aims to be a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing datasets. Utilizing their knowledge in NumPy and Pandas, students will create a series of functions that assist in reading data from a variety of file formats, summarizing datasets, managing missing values, and encoding categorical data.
